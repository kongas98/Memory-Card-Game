In order to run the programm you'll have to install Python from --> https://www.python.org/downloads/
If you don't know how to install Python in your PC you can watch this video --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yivyNCtVVDk
After you downloaded Python you need to open the programm from IDLE or a programm like Visual Studio Code.
The programm itself is a Memory Card Game where you have to find all the matching numbers that are hidden beneath the cards.
The cards appear in this form --> [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]
And the numbers on the cards correspond to the numbers you have to write when you want to "open" a certain card and see its' hidden number.
Then you just follow the rules that the game tells you and you can play the game.
The game also tracks the High score for repetative games. (If the programm stops the highscore restarts)
